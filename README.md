# MEAN Project for Rehab Nexus
This repository showcases some work I did for a client using MongoDB, Express JS, Angular JS and Node JS. I used GET and POST to collect data to store in the database.  I also used Stormpath for the login to the admin database and Sendgrid to send emails and text alerts to the admins.  Some info has been redacted (like API keys) for obvious reasons.

The landing page is a duplication of their existing landing page.
